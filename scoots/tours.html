        <div class="toursText">
            <p>In San Miguel is the Museum of the Island of Cozumel (Museo de la Isla de Cozumel) - the largest and most visited cultural center. 
                The main part of its exposition is also devoted to the Maya Indians.In addition to archaeological artifacts, 
                visitors can see rich collections of natural science and geological exhibits. Visiting large archaeological areas should also be included in your recreation program. 
                In total, there are ten large-scale archaeological areas on the island, the most interesting of which is San Gervasio.</p>

        <h2> Cozumel's Mayan Heritage: San Gervasio</h2>
        <div class="toursText">
            <p>More than 30 Mayan sites have been found on Cozumel, some of them in beautiful locations such as dense jungle or perched above pristine beaches. 
                By far the most important is that of San Gervasio, built in AD 800 and located 16 kilometers from San Miguel de Cozumel. Highlights of a visit include seeing the Temple of 
                Ix-chel, for centuries the focal point of the island's religious life and a place of pilgrimage from across the Mayan empire.
                Also of interest are the nearby ruins at Santa Rita, while a little farther away are the ruins of Santa Pilar and Castillo Real, the latter boasting Cozumel's 
                largest Mayan structure. There are also Mayan remains in the southeast corner of the island at Buenavista and in the south at El Caracol.
                Address: Carretera Transversal Kilómetro 7.5, Centro, 77600 Cozumel, QROO</p>

            <p>A fun place to explore the diversity of Cozumel's coastline and experience its flora and fauna, the Punta Sur Eco Beach Park is the largest eco park on the island. 
                Located at the southern tip of the island, Punta Sur provides plenty of great swimming and beach fun, as well as a chance to enjoy some snorkeling, scuba diving, and kayaking. 
                Part of the 240-plus-acre Parque Punta Sur, it's home to a diversity of beaches, reefs, and lagoons, as well as a forested area with plenty of walking trails.
