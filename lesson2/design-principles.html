            <h3>Why is It Important?</h3>

                As you can see, the top of the page is well centered. 
                All parts of the page are equally spaced from each other, and even the name of the store on the left, 
                seemingly asymmetric, still harmonizes with the search field on the other half.

            <h2>Repetition</h2>
            <h3>Is Repetition helpful?</h3>

                Repetitions are helpful. Here we see that the font, font size, information, and image location are repeated. 
                Thanks to this structure, the user can quickly find the necessary information, 
                which makes the site more attractive and visited.

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
            <h3>We must be able to read the text</h3>

            <p>
                As we can see, all the important information is well readable. 
                Itâ€™s easy for the eye to grab onto the text and quickly read it. 
                The background and font are selected so that the user may not strain his eyesight.
